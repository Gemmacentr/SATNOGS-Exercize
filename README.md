# SATNOGS-Exercise


This was an exercise for the recruiting process of a startup working in this field. They asked me to reconsider the website, which is the following https://network.satnogs.org/, where it's not clear to whom it is addressed, what it shows, why, and when. I have recreated the index where I try to address the initial questions of a website that belongs to a not-so-well-known sector, and I have proposed a new homepage.


Here you can also find the Figma Prototypes I created.
